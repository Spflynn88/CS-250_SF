CS-250 Final

Interpreting user needs is a skill that needs to be developed. You need to know how to interview a client so that you can walk away with the information you need. Turning that interview into user stories is one of the most important aspects of Agile. By taking the customers needs and creating individual and specific tasks makes for a workflow that minimizes confusion and wasted time.

In my future I would not mind working as part of a scrum team in a developer role. I think that having clear direction, via user stories, would make for a good working environment. I have worked several jobs were work needed to be redone due to lack of clarity and it is extremely frustrating. That said, I think communication is the most important aspect of being a good team member.
